User Management REST API (Python & Flask)
This is a simple console-based REST API created for an Elevate Labs internship task. It manages a list of users in memory, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete them.

Features
Create: Add new users to the list via POST requests.

Read: Fetch the list of all users or a single user by their ID using GET requests.

Update: Modify an existing user's details with a PUT request.

Delete: Remove a user from the list using a DELETE request.

In-Memory: All data is stored in a simple Python list, which resets when the app stops.
Check the output: The API will be live and ready for requests at http://127.0.0.1:5000. You can use a tool like Postman or curl to interact with it.
